# Mechanisms of Action Prediction

## Overview
This project is created for [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa) regarding Mechanisms of Action Prediction. To put it simply, this project intends to predict the efficacy of an unseen drugs by observing its reactions to human cells. The process can be translated to a machine learning question as a multi-label classifcation problem.

## Modelling
1. Random Forest: To overcome the challenge that comes with about 1000 features, principal component analyst is performed prior to fitting random forest. 
2. Neural Network
